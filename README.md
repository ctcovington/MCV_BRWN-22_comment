# Mathur, Covington, & VanderWeele Comment on BRWN+22

This repository contains the data setup and analysis code to support our comment on [BRWN+22](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2203150119).

## Analysis
The analysis consists of the two number `Qmd` files in this directory. `01_data_setup` serves only to construct the data set that BRWN+ use for their main analysis (and thus we use for ours) and is largely a reproduction of code that can be found in BRWN+22's 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/nbreznau/CRI). `02_analysis` contains the analysis we reference in our comment.
